# GitHub Action to `git secrets --scan` in your CI  ðŸ”„

This simple action uses [git secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) to scan your repository for secrets being commited to public. 

The action performs `--scan-history` for all the repo revisions/commits and checks for common AWS patterns and ensures that keys present in ~/.aws/credentials are not found in any commit. The following checks are added:

* AWS Access Key IDs via (A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AIDA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}
* AWS Secret Access Key assignments via ":" or "=" surrounded by optional quotes
* AWS account ID assignments via ":" or "=" surrounded by optional quotes
* Allowed patterns for example AWS keys (AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE and wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY)
* Known credentials from ~/.aws/credentials
