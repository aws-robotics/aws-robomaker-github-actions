# GitHub Action to `git secrets --scan` in your CI  ðŸ”„

This simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) and [git secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) to scan your repository for secrets being commited to public.


## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```
name: Sync Bucket
on: push

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: scan-git-secrets
      uses: aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-github-actions/git-secrets-scan-action@2.4.0
```


### Environment Variables

| Key | Value | Type | Required |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` | The GitHub workspace directory path. The workspace directory contains a subdirectory with a copy of your repository if your workflow uses the actions/checkout action. If you don't use the actions/checkout action, the directory will be empty. For example, /home/runner/work/my-repo-name/my-repo-name. This variable is set by GH actions. | `env` | **Yes** |
